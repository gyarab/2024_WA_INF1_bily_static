            <b>Coherence Scanning Interferometry</b> is a measurement method used in the fabrication and analysis
             of optical, semiconductor and other surfaces as well as in applied physics research. We take for example the <b>white light interferometry</b>.
             It uses the interference of two light waves to analyse the <b>topography</b> and <b>characteristics</b> of a
             <b>surface</b>.

                Key to this method is a light source. A coherent light source - point light source e.g. a laser - has lower 
                resolution however greater measurement distance. This is caused by the fact that the waves
                of a coherent light source have a stable phase over large distances, we can see this in our daily lives, a 
                laser pointer shines brighter and farther as opposed to a simple flashlight. However in this field of optics
                or semiconductors the feature size that we want to analyze is very small hence no need for long distance 
                light coherence. Therefore this method doesn't use spatial (long distance) coherence but only 
                <b>temporal coherence</b>. The name of the selected light source is - as hinted by the name of the method 
                - <b>white light source</b>. This broadband light source has a very short coherence length. 
                
                To create a base reference to compare the interfered measurement beam with. This is done either by 
                having two separate light sources or as in the Michelson interferometer, we split a beam of 
                light comning from one source into two separate beams using a beam splitter. Primary beam, 
                which is used as a reference, is sent on a path perpendicular to the sample being scanned, it
                reflects off of a flat reference mirror and is sent back to the beam splitter. In the beam splitter it 
                combines with the secondary beam used to scan the surface of the object. The two beams interfere 
                with each other and this interference is then captured on the detector in form of Z-axis measurement 
                of the profile of the surface compared to the flat reference mirror.

            Other key component is a photodetector. 
            For this any CMOS, CCD or other detectors can be used.
